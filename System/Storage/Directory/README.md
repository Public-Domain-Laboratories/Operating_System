Prints Directory Tree to the standard output.

A Directory is: A folder or container used to organize files on a computer system.  
A Tree is: A data structure composed of nodes where each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes (children).  
A Directory Tree is: A hierarchical representation of directories and files within a file system, organized in a tree-like structure with directories as nodes and files as leaves.  


### What Traversal means
Traversing, in the context of directories or file systems, means navigating through the hierarchical structure of directories and files in a systematic way. When you traverse a directory tree, you're essentially visiting each directory and file within that tree, either to gather information, perform operations, or in this case, to print them in a tree-like format.

Traversing typically involves recursively exploring each directory and its contents, starting from a specified root directory. At each step, you may need to perform certain actions, such as printing directory paths, processing files, or descending into subdirectories.

In the context of the algorithm to print directory paths as a tree, traversing involves recursively exploring each directory and its contents, printing directory paths with proper indentation as you navigate through the directory tree. The traversal continues until all directories and files within the specified directory tree have been visited.
