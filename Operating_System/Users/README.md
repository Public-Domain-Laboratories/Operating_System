Folder of Users, their data and user-wide programs.

Folders are [capitalization-case-insensitive][0].

[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity

The [Username?]() can be used to open path to the current user data files folder.  
`?` is a suffix to denote variable expression.

`./Users/Username?/`

Alternatives:
```
./Users/--User--Username/
./Users/--User--Home/
```

Relative path to the User can be gained with [Username?/]()  
`Username?/`

Users and Usernames should be encrypted unless viewed by Administrator.

Alias: Homes, Profiles, Accounts.
