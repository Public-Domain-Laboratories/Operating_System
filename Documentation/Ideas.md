Ability to join/connect multiple folders.


.md = markdown, metadata - data about data.

Scan for incorrect documentation: incorrect folders.

More than 3 depth folders might be frustrating to navigate the project.

Each .md readme should contain a tree map with current position highlighted, ability to move to other places around Operating System.

Treat special words like "Operating System" as "Operating_System": automatically making into a link.


Idea for commands:  
`File new "./textfile.txt"`  
`File new textFile "./file"`  
 

Folders should be created according to the target to be achieved:  
**Example:** Working on printing folder structure:   
* Operating_System/System/Print_Folder_Structure/Algorithms  
* Operating_System/System/Print_Folder_Structure/Research  
* Operating_System/System/Print_Folder_Structure/Implementation
  
The folder structure starts with the `Print_Folder_Structure` as target of the project.

Command Line, could be the title of an interactive console.

http://operating-system.io operating-system.sh operating-system.wiki operating-system.dev operating-system.digital operating-system.online operating-system.host operating-system.link operating-system.site operating-system.tools operating-system.systems


Workshop or Lab, could be the directory names used for temporary experimentation projects.


New name for the project: 
Lab_Operating_System  
Computer_Operating_System  


Idea: Source control README: List recent projects in this Monolithic repostiory


Idea: Recursion can be visualized as a Label and GOTO
